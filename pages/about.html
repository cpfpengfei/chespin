            <p>
                Hey there! I am <b>Nelson</b> from Singapore, a student at National University of Singapore (NUS).
                After an amazing internship at a startup company, I am aspiring to become a <b>solutions architect.</b>
                I have a keen interest in cloud infrastructure, machine learning and frontend web development,
                as DevOps, data analytics, software development need to go hand-in-hand to create useful,
                production-ready technology for businesses to thrive. As a business student, my life purpose is to
                develop useful applications that can be integrated with operations to create business value.
            </p>
            <p>
                I strongly believe that students should always strive to learn skills that are not taught in
                school, as technology is always evolving. That being said, I am grateful for the opportunities
                that NUS and Residential College 4 have provided for me — a community of learners, connections
                and resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past 2 years, I took part in numerous technology-related competitions ("Hackathons")
                such as the CIMB  3D Conquest and AWS Build On 2019, as I believe these experiences
                teach me skills that cannot be learnt in school. Furthermore, I take pride in personal
                projects, and I am currently learning <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>
                to create a fullstack
                <a href="https://nelsonlim96.github.io/">web application</a>
                as my personal website.

            <p>
                For the past 2 years, I have had many amazing experiences in NUS. Here is a timeline of
                my most significant milestones:

                    <p class="remove-padding">
                        I used Python to automate the data analytics pipeline for the Customer Service teams to
                        create the daily report for reporting to senior management for decision making.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learnt how to write production-ready code for the Spark server using object-oriented
                        programming. As my job involved mainly querying data from Salesforce and writing data to
                        Google Spreadsheets, I am familiar with their API.

                    <p>
                        Carigos was experimenting with the possibility of automating the process of handling
                        customer enquiries on WhatsApp with the help of a chatbot. I developed and tested several
                        SaaS such as Amazon Lex, Verloop and Snatchbot. I successfully integrated the data
                        pipelines with Airtable, our CRM, with the help of Zapier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also experimented with live dashboards with PowerBI and Tableau. I later discovered
                        Metabase after attending a Stashaway Data Science talk, and introduced it to the team
                        at a Brown Bag Session. It was later taken up by the CTO and CPO to track the user metrics
                        by connecting to our Google Analytics account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My biggest takeaway from this internship was learning about how to tailor a web platform to
                        meet the needs of the operations team. My experience includes observing how customers behave
                        on our website (Inspectlet), conducting User Acceptance Testing, automating workflows
                        (Zapier, Front and Cognito Forms), using Amazon Web Services (devOps),
                        learning about React (frontend), Spring Framework (backend).

                    <p>
                        My role initially started off as an ad-hoc project. I was tasked to create a predictive
                        analytics model by <a src="http://jussikeppo.com/">Associate Professor Jussi Keppo</a>.
                        Eventually, I was hired as a Research Assistant. My work revolves around grading
                        assignments and applying machine learning to econometric models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learnt a lot about how theory is put into practice under Professor Jussi, but
                        unfortunately due to privacy requirements I cannot reveal any more.

                        NUS BACT was my first foray into the realm of data analytics and coding. BACT under
                        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ganesh.muthupalani">Ganesh</a>
                        encouraged independent learning, which suited my style.
                        <a href="https://github.com/Angps1995">Peng Seng's</a> resources were extremely helpful
                        in particular, and I was inspired by how much the senior members knew. This experience
                        shaped my learning philosophy, as I believe that you don't need someone to teach you; just
                        someone to point you in the right direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I became Secretary/Treasurer for AY18/19, together with President
                        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/unknownftw">Ting Wei</a> and my fellow RA
                        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alexander.leong.9">Alex Leong</a> as Vice-President.
                        Our exco's style was to find the right balance of teaching and "doing" by incorporating
                        teaching sessions, followed by group projects in Semester 2. Although I preferred
                        Ganesh's style, having more guidance helped newer members from being lost.

                    <p>
                        Being a freshman is tough. New to university and straight out of army, I could not
                        get accustomed to university life. RC4 changed this. My friends at RC4 inspired me to
                        become a better person — to work hard, to socialise more, and participate in events.
                        They are great companions when I feel like a disappointment, and in small achievements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By living with others, you can see how they live their lives, and in doing so, your beliefs
                        about your own way of living are challenged. When I stayed with my family, I lived in
                        a bubble. Now I know what it is like to truly live a meaningful life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides the tangible benefits, RC4 is a really fun place to be in. The late night suppers,
                        chatting over breakfast/dinner, going out to Clementi after a long week, going to JB. There
                        is never a dull moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will always remember that RC4 is home to me.
